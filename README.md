# Angio_early_bone_healing

Mechano-biological model of angiogenesis and stromal cell organization during early bone healing (7 days). The model replicates the longitudinal section of the healing region of a mouse femoral osteotomy subjected to in vivo-like loading and stabilized with a rigid or semi rigid fixator.

Coupled agent-based model (in C++) and finite element analysis (with Abaqus). 
"Baseline code C++" contains agent-based model files. Abaqus input files for each scenario (rigid fixator, semirigid fixator, unloaded) are written at each iteration from the agent-based model starting from the corresponding txt file in "Text input files".
